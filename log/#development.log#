All grips are placed well, buttons are within easy reach and the finish is really refined for a camera of its class. Considering the D7000's main competitor is the Canon 60D, the Nikon is leaps and bounds ahead in build quality and overall look-and-feel.\r\n\r\nThe sensor is an overhauled 16.2-megapixel CMOS in Nikon's DX (APS-C size equivalent) format with improved analog-to-digital conversion with 14-bit processing, thanks to the new processor.\r\n\r\nWhat's nice in the D7000's dial implementation is the dual-shooting mode and options dials placed one on top of the other. You can easily switch in and out of all your PASM modes and then just as quickly launch into single, continuous, quiet or timer shooting via the secondary dial. Screen specs are the standard 3-inch, 920,000-dot display we're used to seeing from Nikon's higher-end dSLR stable. The viewfinder is bright and clear and gives 100 per cent coverage, equivalent to that found in the higher-end D300s model.", "title"=>"Nikon D7000 DSLR with 18-105mm Lens Kit"}, "commit"=>"Update Product"}
